# Cloud-Hosting-Website

Building a clone of a Cloud Hosting Website with HTML, CSS Grid, Flexbox and JavaScript! I will be commenting on many lines of code to get a better understanding of how CSS Grid works along with JavaScript functions within an actual working website. 

Leared various new CSS techniques during this build such as animations, keyframes, custom root properties, and media queries. I also became more familiar with font-awesome and the many uses of styling basic icons. 

Overall, the website build was very helpful in gaining a better understanding of CSS. I intend to use some of this code to create a personal website with new animations and media queries. 

The website will be deployed to Netlify
